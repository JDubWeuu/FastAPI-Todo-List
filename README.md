# FastAPI-Todo-List
Implemented a To-Do List backend with FastAPI and SQLite. Features include creating a todo entry, deleting a todo entry, fetching entire todo list from database, checking off a todo, exporting it as a csv, and basic HTTP user authentication. 
- Utilized the fundamental HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

Run commands ``uvicorn main:app --reload`` to start the FastAPI application, and redirect to ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`` to test the API.
